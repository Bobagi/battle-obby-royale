--[[
	OneWayPlatformsScript - This script sets up the collision groups for one way platforms. This is
	necessary to avoid issues with moving platforms and distributed physics simulation.

	For example: If a player is above a platform (i.e. CanCollide = true) and has simulation ownership of it,
	its movement will be affected since the client sees it as collidable. This can lead to cases where the
	platform will run into other characters and glitch out.

	To fix this, we assign the platforms and characters to collision groups which do not collide with each other.
	Each player locally assigns their character back to a collision group which does collide with the platforms.
	This allows the client to simulate collisions with its own character but not with other characters.
